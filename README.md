# biodiversity_analysis
For this project we are creating a dashboard that shows the the bacterial ecosystem of anonymous test subjects. The purpose of the study is to determine what bacteria are common in human bellybuttons and if any of them can be useful for meat synthesisation. Subjects can see the results of their naval sample in the created dashboard.
